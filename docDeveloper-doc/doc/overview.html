<p>
<b>Niagara</b>: a Java software framework and infrastructure with a 
focus on three major problems:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Integrating heterogeneous systems, protocols, and fieldbuses;</li>
<li>Empowering non-programmers to build applications using graphical
programming tools;</li>
<li>Targeted for highly distributed, embedded systems;</li>
</ul>

<h2>Java</h2>
<p>
The framework uses the Java VM as a common runtime environment 
across various operating systems and hardware platforms.  The core
framework scales from small embedded controllers to high end servers.
The framework runtime is targeted for Java 8 SE compact3 profile compliant
VMs.  The user interface toolkit and graphical programming tools are
targeted for Java 8 SE VMs.
</p>

<h2>Integrating Heterogeneous Systems</h2>
<p>
Niagara is designed from the ground up to assume that there will
never be any one "standard" network protocol, distributed architecture,
or fieldbus.  Niagara's design center is to integrate cleanly with
all networks and protocols.  The Niagara Framework standardizes what's 
inside the box, not what the box talks to.
</p>

<h2>Programming for Non-programmers</h2>
<p>
Most features in the Niagara Framework are designed for dual use.
These features are designed around a set of Java APIs to be accessed
by developers writing Java code.  At the same, most features are also
designed to be used through high level graphical programming and
configuration tools.  This vastly increases the scope of users capable
of building applications on the Niagara platform.
</p>

<h2>Embedded Systems</h2>
<p>
Niagara is targeted for embedded systems capable of running a Java
VM.  This excludes low devices without 32-bit processors or several
megs of RAM.  But even embedded systems with the horsepower of
low end workstations have special needs.  They are always headless
and require remote administration.  Embedded systems also tend to use
solid state storage with limited write cycles and much smaller volume 
capacities than hard drives.
</p>

<h2>Distributed Systems</h2>
<p>
The framework is designed to provide scalability to highly distributed 
systems composed of 10,000s of nodes running the Niagara Framework software.
Systems of this size span a wide range of network topologies and usually
communicate over unreliable Internet connections.  Niagara is designed to
provide an infrastructure for managing systems of this scale.
</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------------->
<h1 id="components">Component Software</h1>
<!------------------------------------------------------------->

<p>
Niagara tackles these challenges by using an architecture centered
around the concept of "Component Oriented Development".  Components
are pieces of self-describing software that can be assembled like
building blocks to create new applications.  A component centric 
architecture solves many problems in Niagara:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Components provide a model used to normalize the data and
features of heterogeneous protocols and networks so that they 
can be integrated seamlessly.</li>
<li>Applications can be assembled with components using graphical
tools.  This allows new applications to be built without requiring
a Java developer.</li>
<li>Components provide unsurpassed visibility into applications.
Since components are self-describing, it is very easy for tools to
introspect how an application is assembled, configured, and what
is occurring at any point in time.  This provides immense value in
debugging and maintaining Niagara applications.</li>
<li>Components enable software reuse.</li>
</ul>
