<h1 class='title'>API Information</h1> 

<!------------------------------------------------------------->
<h1 id="baja">Overview</h1>
<!------------------------------------------------------------->

<p>
There are a huge number of APIs available which are documented to 
varying degrees.  In working with a specific API there are a couple
key points to understand:
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Stability</b>: a designation for the maturity of the API
and its likelihood for incompatible changes;</li>   

<li><b>Baja vs Tridium</b>: public APIs are published under 
<code>java.baja</code> packages, and implementation specific
code is published under <code>com.tridium</code>;</li>  

</ul> 

<!------------------------------------------------------------->
<h1 id="stability">Stability</h1>
<!------------------------------------------------------------->

<p>
Public APIs are classified into three categories:
</p>

<ul>

<li><b>Stable</b>: this designation is for mature APIs which have
been thoroughly evaluated and locked down. Every attempt is made to keep stable
APIs source compatible between releases (a recompile may be necessary). Only
critical bug fixes or design flaws are just cause to break compatibility, and
even then only between major revisions (such 3.0 to 3.1). This does not mean
that stable APIs are frozen, they will continue to be enhanced with new classes
and new methods. But no existing classes or methods will be removed.
</li>   

<li><b>Evaluation</b>: this designation is for a functionally complete
API published for public use.  Evaluation APIs are mature
enough to use for production development.  However, they have not
received enough utilization and feedback to justify locking them down. 
Evaluation APIs will likely undergo minor modification between
major revisions (such 3.0 to 3.1).  These changes will likely break
both binary and source compatibility.  However, any changes should
be easily incorporated into production code with reasonable refactoring
of the source code (such as a method being renamed).  
</li>   

<li><b>Development</b>: this designation is for code actively under
development.  It is published for customers who need the latest 
development build of the framework.  Non-compatible changes should be 
expected, with the potential for large scale redesign.
</li>   

</ul>

<!------------------------------------------------------------->
<h1 id="baja">What is Baja?</h1>
<!------------------------------------------------------------->

<p>Baja is a term coined from <b>B</b>uilding <b>A</b>utomation
<b>J</b>ava <b>A</b>rchitecture.  The core framework built by
Tridium is designed to be published as an open standard.  This
standard is being developed through Sun's <a name="javaCommunityProcess">Java Community Process</a>
as JSR 60.  This JSR is still an ongoing effort, but it is important
to understand the distinction between Baja and Niagara.  
</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------------->
<h1 id="specificationVsImplementation">Specification versus Implementation</h1>
<!------------------------------------------------------------->

<p>
Fundamentally Baja is an open specification and the Niagara 
Framework is an implementation of that specification.  As a specification,
Baja is not a set of software, but rather purely a set of documentation.
The <a name="bajaSpecification">Baja specification</a> will include:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Standards for how Baja software modules are packaged;</li>
<li>The component model and its APIs;</li>
<li>Historical database components and APIs;</li>
<li>Alarming components and APIs;</li>
<li>Control logic components and APIs;</li>
<li>Scheduling components and APIs;</li>
<li>BACnet driver components and APIs;</li>
<li>Lonworks driver components and APIs;</li>
</ul>

<p>
Over time many more specifications for features will be added to Baja.
But what is important to remember is that Baja is only a specification.
Niagara is an implementation of that specification.  Furthermore you will
find a vast number of features in Niagara, that are not included under 
the Baja umbrella.  In this respect Niagara provides a superset of the
Baja features.
</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------------->
<h1><code>javax.baja</code> versus <code>com.tridium</code></h1>
<!------------------------------------------------------------->

<p>
Many features found in Niagara are exposed through a set of <a name="javaApis">Java APIs</a>.  
In the Java world APIs are grouped together into <i>packages</i>, which 
are scoped using DNS domain names.  Software developed through the Java 
Community Process is usually scoped by packages starting with <code>java</code> 
or <code>javax</code>.  The APIs developed for Baja are all grouped under 
<code>javax.baja</code>.  These are APIs that will be part of the open 
Baja specification and maybe implemented by vendors other than Tridium.  
Using these APIs guarantees a measure of vendor neutrality and backward 
compatibility.
</p>

<p>
Software developed by Tridium which is proprietary and outside of the
Baja specification is grouped under the <code>com.tridium</code>
packages.  The <code>com.tridium</code> packages contain code specific 
to how Niagara implements the Baja APIs.  The <code>com.tridium</code>
code may or may not be documented.  Most often these packages have their 
components and slots documented (doc=bajaonly), but not their low level 
fields and methods.  In general <code>com.tridium</code> APIs should never 
be used by developers, and no compatibility is guaranteed. 
</p>

<p class='note'>
Note:  Tridium has developed some APIs under <code>javax.baja</code> 
even though they are not currently part of the Baja specification.  
These are APIs that Tridium feels may eventually be published through 
Baja, but are currently in a development stage.
