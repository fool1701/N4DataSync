3. **Create PR**: Issue automatically moves to Review
4. **Merge PR**: Issue automatically moves to Done

#### Weekly Review
1. **Backlog Grooming**: Prioritize and estimate new issues
2. **Progress Review**: Check WIP limits and blockers
3. **Milestone Progress**: Review milestone completion

#### Sprint Planning (Bi-weekly)
1. **Velocity Review**: Check completed story points
2. **Capacity Planning**: Plan next sprint work
3. **Goal Setting**: Define sprint objectives

### 8. Metrics to Track

#### Velocity Metrics
- Story points completed per sprint
- Cycle time (Ready â†’ Done)
- Lead time (Backlog â†’ Done)
- Throughput (issues completed per week)

#### Quality Metrics
- Bug rate (bugs per feature)
- Rework rate (issues reopened)
- Review time (In Progress â†’ Review â†’ Done)

#### Health Indicators
