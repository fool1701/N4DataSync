# Version Management & Development Standards

## **Git Workflow Standards**

### **Branch Strategy**
- **`main`**: Production-ready code only
- **`develop`**: Integration branch for features (if using GitFlow)
- **Feature branches**: `feature/ISSUE-NUMBER-short-description`
- **Hotfix branches**: `hotfix/ISSUE-NUMBER-short-description`
- **Release branches**: `release/vX.Y.Z`

### **Commit Standards**

#### **Commit Message Format**
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

#### **Types**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Build process, dependencies, etc.
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `ci`: CI/CD changes

#### **Examples**
```bash
feat(profile): add connection validation to BConnectionProfile

- Add null/empty validation to all setters
- Add format validation for paths and URLs
- Throw IllegalArgumentException for invalid inputs

Closes #2
```

```bash
fix(persistence): resolve JSON serialization issue with BAbsTime

The ProfileManager was failing to serialize BAbsTime objects correctly,
causing profile save operations to fail silently.

- Convert BAbsTime to ISO string format for JSON
- Add proper error handling for time conversion
- Update tests to verify time serialization

Fixes #15
```

### **When to Commit**
- **Logical units**: Each commit should represent one logical change
- **Working state**: Code should compile and basic tests should pass
- **Atomic changes**: Don't mix unrelated changes in one commit
- **Frequent commits**: Commit often, push when feature/fix is complete

### **When to Push**
- **Feature complete**: When a feature is fully implemented and tested
- **End of work session**: Push work-in-progress to backup
- **Before switching branches**: Ensure work is saved remotely
- **After successful tests**: Push after local tests pass

### **Pull Request Standards**

#### **PR Title Format**
```
[TYPE] Brief description of changes
```

#### **PR Requirements**
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] No merge conflicts
- [ ] Linked to relevant issues
- [ ] Security review (if applicable)

## **Issue Management Standards**

### **Issue Types & Labels**
- `bug`: Something isn't working
- `enhancement`: New feature or improvement
- `tech-debt`: Code quality improvements
- `security`: Security-related issues
- `documentation`: Documentation improvements
- `testing`: Test-related issues

### **Priority Labels**
- `priority/critical`: Blocks release or causes data loss
- `priority/high`: Important functionality affected
- `priority/medium`: Quality or performance issue
- `priority/low`: Nice to have improvement

### **Status Labels**
- `status/needs-triage`: Needs initial review
- `status/in-progress`: Currently being worked on
- `status/blocked`: Waiting for external dependency
- `status/ready-for-review`: Ready for code review

### **Issue Templates**
- Bug reports with reproduction steps
- Feature requests with acceptance criteria
- Technical debt with impact assessment

## **Release Management**

### **Semantic Versioning**
- **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH** (e.g., 1.2.3)
- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes
- **MINOR**: New features (backward compatible)
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes (backward compatible)

### **Pre-release Versions**
- `1.0.0-alpha.1`: Early development
- `1.0.0-beta.1`: Feature complete, testing
- `1.0.0-rc.1`: Release candidate

### **Release Process**
1. Create release branch from `develop`
2. Update version numbers and changelog
3. Run full test suite
4. Create release PR to `main`
5. Tag release after merge
6. Deploy to production
7. Merge back to `develop`

## **Code Quality Gates**

### **Pre-commit Checks**
- Code formatting (automated)
- Lint checks
- Unit tests pass
- No security vulnerabilities

### **Pre-merge Checks**
- All tests pass (unit, integration)
- Code coverage meets threshold (85%+)
- Security scan passes
- Documentation updated
- Performance regression check

### **Release Checks**
- Full test suite passes
- Security audit complete
- Performance benchmarks met
- Documentation complete
- Migration scripts tested

## **Automation Standards**

### **CI/CD Pipeline Stages**
1. **Build**: Compile and package
2. **Test**: Unit, integration, security tests
3. **Quality**: Code coverage, static analysis
4. **Deploy**: Automated deployment to staging
5. **Release**: Manual promotion to production

### **Automated Checks**
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Code quality metrics
- Test coverage reporting
- Performance monitoring
- Security compliance

## **Documentation Standards**

### **Required Documentation**
- README with setup instructions
- CHANGELOG with release notes
- API documentation (Javadoc)
- Architecture decisions (ADRs)
- Troubleshooting guides

### **Documentation Updates**
- Update with every feature
- Version with releases
- Review quarterly
- Keep examples current

## **Security Standards**

### **Secrets Management**
- Never commit secrets to Git
- Use environment variables
- Encrypt sensitive configuration
- Regular secret rotation

### **Code Security**
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Static code analysis
- Security code reviews
- Regular security audits

## **Monitoring & Metrics**

### **Development Metrics**
- Lead time (idea to production)
- Deployment frequency
- Mean time to recovery
- Change failure rate

### **Quality Metrics**
- Code coverage percentage
- Technical debt ratio
- Bug escape rate
- Customer satisfaction

## **Team Collaboration**

### **Code Review Standards**
- All code must be reviewed
- Focus on logic, security, maintainability
- Provide constructive feedback
- Approve only when confident

### **Communication**
- Use issue comments for technical discussion
- PR descriptions explain the "why"
- Regular team sync meetings
- Document decisions in ADRs
