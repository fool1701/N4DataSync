# Professional Project Management Standards

## **Project Tracking Philosophy**

Professional developers use systematic approaches to track features, bugs, and technical debt. This ensures nothing falls through the cracks and provides visibility into project health and progress.

## **GitHub Issues as Single Source of Truth**

### **Why GitHub Issues?**
- **Centralized**: All project work tracked in one place
- **Integrated**: Links directly to code changes via PRs
- **Searchable**: Easy to find historical decisions and discussions
- **Automated**: Can trigger workflows and notifications
- **Collaborative**: Team members can comment and collaborate

### **Issue Lifecycle**
```
[New] → [Triaged] → [In Progress] → [Review] → [Done] → [Closed]
```

## **Issue Categories & Management**

### **1. Feature Requests**
- **Purpose**: New functionality or enhancements
- **Template**: User story format with acceptance criteria
- **Labels**: `enhancement`, `priority/*`, `milestone/*`
- **Estimation**: Story points or time estimates
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Clear, testable requirements

### **2. Bug Reports**
- **Purpose**: Issues with existing functionality
- **Template**: Steps to reproduce, expected vs actual behavior
- **Labels**: `bug`, `priority/*`, `severity/*`
- **Triage**: Severity assessment and assignment
- **Root Cause**: Analysis and prevention measures

### **3. Technical Debt**
- **Purpose**: Code quality, architecture, and maintenance issues
- **Template**: Current state, problems, proposed solution
- **Labels**: `tech-debt`, `priority/*`, `effort/*`
- **Impact Assessment**: Risk and benefit analysis
- **Scheduling**: Regular debt reduction sprints

### **4. Security Issues**
- **Purpose**: Security vulnerabilities and improvements
- **Template**: Vulnerability description, impact, solution
- **Labels**: `security`, `priority/critical`
- **Confidentiality**: Private issues for sensitive security matters
- **Response Time**: Immediate attention for critical issues

## **Milestone Management**

### **Release Milestones**
- **V1.0 MVP**: Core functionality for initial release
- **V1.1 Enhancements**: First round of improvements
- **V2.0 Major Features**: Significant new capabilities

### **Sprint Milestones**
- **Sprint 1**: 2-week focused development cycles
- **Sprint 2**: Continuous delivery approach
- **Hotfix**: Emergency fixes outside normal cycle

## **Project Boards (Kanban)**

### **Board Columns**
1. **Backlog**: All identified work items
2. **Ready**: Prioritized and ready to start
3. **In Progress**: Currently being worked on
4. **Review**: Code review and testing
5. **Done**: Completed and merged
6. **Released**: Deployed to production

### **Work in Progress (WIP) Limits**
- **In Progress**: Max 3 items per developer
- **Review**: Max 5 items total
- **Focus**: Finish work before starting new items

## **Estimation and Planning**

### **Story Points (Fibonacci Scale)**
- **1**: Trivial change (< 1 hour)
- **2**: Simple change (1-2 hours)
- **3**: Small feature (half day)
- **5**: Medium feature (1 day)
- **8**: Large feature (2-3 days)
- **13**: Complex feature (1 week)
- **21**: Epic (needs breakdown)

### **Planning Process**
1. **Backlog Grooming**: Weekly review and prioritization
2. **Sprint Planning**: Select work for next iteration
3. **Daily Standups**: Progress updates and blockers
4. **Sprint Review**: Demo completed work
5. **Retrospective**: Process improvement discussion

## **Quality Gates and Definition of Done**

### **Feature Definition of Done**
- [ ] Code implemented and reviewed
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Security review completed
- [ ] Performance impact assessed
- [ ] User acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Deployed to staging environment

### **Bug Fix Definition of Done**
- [ ] Root cause identified
- [ ] Fix implemented and reviewed
- [ ] Regression tests added
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Fix verified in staging
- [ ] Prevention measures considered

## **Communication and Collaboration**

### **Issue Communication**
- **Comments**: Technical discussions and decisions
- **Mentions**: Notify relevant team members
- **Labels**: Status and priority updates
- **Linking**: Connect related issues and PRs

### **Status Updates**
- **Weekly**: Progress reports on active milestones
- **Monthly**: Overall project health assessment
- **Quarterly**: Strategic review and planning

## **Metrics and Reporting**

### **Velocity Tracking**
- **Story Points**: Completed per sprint
- **Cycle Time**: Time from start to completion
- **Lead Time**: Time from request to delivery
- **Throughput**: Issues completed per time period

### **Quality Metrics**
- **Bug Rate**: New bugs per feature delivered
- **Escape Rate**: Bugs found in production
- **Technical Debt**: Ratio of debt to new features
- **Code Coverage**: Percentage of code tested

### **Health Indicators**
- **Open Issues**: Total and by category
- **Age of Issues**: How long items stay open
- **Priority Distribution**: Balance of urgent vs planned work
- **Team Capacity**: Workload and availability

## **Risk Management**

### **Risk Categories**
- **Technical**: Architecture, dependencies, complexity
- **Schedule**: Timeline, resource availability
- **Quality**: Testing, security, performance
- **External**: Third-party dependencies, requirements changes

### **Risk Mitigation**
- **Early Identification**: Regular risk assessment
- **Contingency Planning**: Alternative approaches
- **Communication**: Stakeholder awareness
- **Monitoring**: Continuous risk tracking

## **Tools Integration**

### **GitHub Features**
- **Issues**: Primary tracking mechanism
- **Projects**: Kanban boards and planning
- **Milestones**: Release and sprint management
- **Labels**: Categorization and filtering
- **Automation**: Workflow triggers and notifications

### **External Integrations**
- **CI/CD**: Automatic issue updates from builds
- **Monitoring**: Production issue creation
- **Documentation**: Links to relevant docs
- **Communication**: Slack/Teams notifications

## **Best Practices**

### **Issue Creation**
- **Clear Titles**: Descriptive and searchable
- **Detailed Descriptions**: Context and requirements
- **Proper Labels**: Consistent categorization
- **Assignees**: Clear ownership
- **Due Dates**: Realistic timelines

### **Issue Management**
