## Legend
- 游댮 **Critical**: Blocks MVP or creates security risks
- 游리 **Important**: Should be fixed before production deployment
- 游릭 **Nice to Have**: Quality improvements for future iterations

## Review Schedule
- **Weekly**: Update status and reprioritize
- **Before MVP**: Address all Critical items
- **Before Production**: Address all Critical and Important items

## Notes
- All issues should have corresponding GitHub issues for detailed tracking
- Effort estimates: Small (< 2h), Medium (2-8h), Large (> 8h)
- Priority can change based on development needs
